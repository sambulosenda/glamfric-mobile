# Development Environment Variables
# Set EXPO_PUBLIC_FORCE_ONBOARDING=true to always show onboarding screen in development mode
# This overrides the normal onboarding completion state for testing purposes

# To enable forced onboarding during development:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_FORCE_ONBOARDING=true

# To reset onboarding state once (useful if persisted state is causing issues):
# EXPO_PUBLIC_RESET_ONBOARDING=true

# To disable (default behavior - respects onboarding completion state):
# EXPO_PUBLIC_FORCE_ONBOARDING=false
